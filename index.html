          <h3>Hard work</h3>
          <div class="rubric-block">

             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of hard work cannot be understated for men who seek to control
              their own destiny. If are content to merely let life happen to you, then you can
              avoid hard work. But if you want to take charge and create a life of your own
              desires then you will have to be ready for the challenge.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every man has two choices in life. On the one hand you can accept the hand
               that you have been dealt and let things happen. On the other hand you can be the
               master of your own life by setting goals and taking steps to achieve them.
               In reality you fluctuate between these two extremes all the time, sometimes
               going with the flow and sometimes taking massive strides to achieve an outcome.
               The question you have to ask yourself is to which direction do you predominantly
               lean? Do you meander through life most of the time and only occasionally stand up
               and forcibly change direction? Or are you the kind of man who is confident being
               in charge and will make things happen for himself? If you want to achieve anything
               in life the latter is where you need to be. This is where the importance of hard
               work comes into it. If you are not happy to merely drift along with the hand life
               has dealt you then you need to identify the new direction you need to take. You
               must set a goal and then you must work hard to go in that direction and achieve
               the goal. Those men who drift through life are the ones who tend to work boring
               jobs, are overweight, have unfulfilling relationships and stick through it all
               because they lack the willpower to change anything. Those men who value hard work
               are fit, healthy and energetic in life with rewarding careers. This is because
               things didn't just fall into their lap, they set ambitious goals and worked hard
               to achieve them. There is a division in the world between real adults and kidults.
               Kidults are lazy and entitled and lead unfulfilling lifes. You want to join the
               ranks of the real adults who know the importance of hard work.</p>

               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard work is not easy by definition. That is the great thing about it. Weak
               people will give up, while the strong will persevere and reap the rewards.
               Challenging yourself with hard work builds discipline, tenacity and character,
               which are invaluable traits to have. </p>

               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be hard physical work or hard mental work. Both build discipline and
               character. You build upon your ability to handle hard work the more you do it.
               In this sense it is like a muscle, growing stronger every time it is exercised.</p>

               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why you should never get lazy in life and should always be challenging
               yourself. It is not the end result that is important. It is the fact that you set
               a goal and worked hard to achieve it by swimming against the tide. When you learn
               how to do that then anything in life becomes possible.</p>

               <h4>True happiness</h3>
               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Englishman, a Frenchman, and a Russian were once discussing the meaning of true happiness.</p>
               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Englishman said, "True happiness, my friends, is rising early on a frosty autumn morning, getting on top of a good horse, and galloping off behind the hounds in pursuit of the fox. A hard ride over fields and fences and rivulets until the fox is brought down. A ride back with the ears and the tail and then sitting before a roaring fire with a glass of good port. Ah, that is true happiness."</p>
               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frenchman said, "That is not true happiness. That is merely animal pleasure. True happiness is meeting with the love of your life, having an intimate meal in a topnotch restaurant with champagne, and then retiring to a wonderful hotel room, where you can make frantic and impassioned love all night long. Ah, that is true happiness."</p>
               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Russian said, "That is not true happiness. That is merely a good time. True happiness comes when you are sitting in your apartment after a hard day at the factory, your little Ivan on your knee, and reading your copy of 'Pravda'. There comes a knock at the door. Three men in ill-fitting brown suits come storming in and say, 'Stepan Stepanovich?' and you say, 'He lives in the room upstairs.' Ah, that is true happiness.</p>
